# Next-Express
 Simple monorepo app built with **Next** & **Express**. I opted to use Next.js instead of vanilla React because it allows for faster project setup with TypeScript, Tailwind, and testing configurations. The app features a simple UI, testing suites (using Jest) and a single API route that solves the following problem:

 _Given the upper limit of **n**, find the median prime number(s) of the set of prime numbers less than **n**._
